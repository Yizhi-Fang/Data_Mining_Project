## Project of Introduction to Data Mining course

The main goal is, given 400+ research paper, construct the data cube and design 3 data mining tasks accordingly:
1.  Manually annotate 20 paper and determine keywords in Method, Problem, Metric and Dataset;
2.  Automatic annotate all research paper by searching keyword from step 1 and simultaneously save its 2-nearest neighbor words;
3.  Construct data cube with Method, Problem, Metric and Dataset as 4 dimensions and count of related paper as measure;
4.  Discover frequent multi-dimensional pattern in Neural Netowk or Deep Learning related paper with Apriori algorithm;
5.  Find topics in Method with K-Means clustering and display topic words with Word Cloud;
6.  Determine a term is Method or Problem using its 2-nearest neighbor words with Logistic SVM classification with SGD training.
